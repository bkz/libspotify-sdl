This is a straight port of the jukebox.c example in the libspotify (linux) SDK to SDL.

Make sure you have libspotify and libSDL includes and libs on your search path
and do one of the following:

OSX (GCC):

    g++ -o spotify-jukebox jukebox.cpp -framework SDL -framework libspotify

Linux (GCC):

    g++ -o spotify-jukebox jukebox.cpp -lSDL -lSDLmain -lspotify

Windows (MSVC)

    Create an empty Win32 C++ console solution and add jukebox.cpp to it.
    Build the solution, it should automatically link with libspotify.lib,
    SDL.lib, SDLmain.lib (see the pragmas in jukebox.cpp).

Why do I need this?

    Get rid of your alarm! Create a playlist and setup crontab :)

    30 07 * * * ~/bin/jukebox -u username -p password -l Alarm -d
